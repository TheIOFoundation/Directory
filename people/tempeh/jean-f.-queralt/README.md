# Jean F. Queralt

Jean F. Queralt (John) is the Founder and CEO of [The IO Foundation](https://theiofoundation.org), a tech nonprofit advocating for [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAbout).

Disturbed by the level of intrusion of technology in the lives of citizens, he took the leap in 2018 of starting The IO Foundation to establish a more solid and targeted direction to address users' protection from a technical standards perspective.

He is actively involved in Standard Developing Organizations such as the [ITU](https://itu.int), [IETF](https://ietf.org) and [ICANN](https://icann.org).

Because he regards technologists as the [next generation of rights defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen), he works to raise awareness on the importance of these organizations across the technical community and facilitates their participation in them.
